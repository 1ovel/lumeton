2021-01-10T11:29:42.732000,Cleaning of snow from the Metsävääway from Itäkeskus to Marjaniemi,"Hi again, I have to remind you of the title thing every winter. I have lived ___ for over 30 years and as long as Itäkeskus has been a traffic center so I have had to resemble that. Winter plowing on the fairway. So the fairway begins with the statue of friendship and ends at the intersection of Cat Clock and Palopirtintie. There is no name on the fairway and that is why it does not belong to any cleaning group. However, it is also the only walking route for Marjaniemi's playground and a shop. Not all that it is left to plow, but when the cat bells' pedestrian lane is plowed, its snow is dipped at the beginning of the wild lane so that after the heavy snow is impossible, you can overcome. However, it is the only 'path' for our Marjaniemi walkers that leads to Itäkeskus. In the past, the traffic lights close to the statue of the Park Park have been given to that place precisely because the Marjaniemi people have demanded it. Currently, there are still many large construction sites next to the park that it is impossible to get to Itäkeskus like this parkway. I have previously suggested that you give the fairway a 'own name' that you use to remind the plowing group at the beginning of the winter to which the plow belongs. I would like to finally get this thing in order so that every winter would not have to resemble you. Last week I met Stara's car on the fairway and told them my case (2 people in the car). Apparently they have not taken the matter forward. What do you drive there, unless you take such things forward. Hopefully you will get this up before next week's big snowstorms coming. Thank you,
","

Today, snow plowing at Käätypolku, 00950 Helsinki was only performed on one side. All other adjacent streets have been talked about on both sides, so there is no expected plowing car to come to this street. Thanks, however, for the early plowing, but the street is otherwise narrow, so mutual plowing is needed. There are plenty of elderly people on the street.","Hey,

Thank you for your message and apologies for not being happy with the winter maintenance level.

During such an exceptionally dense snowfall, it is often the practice to plow the sidewalks on only one side. In this case, resources can be used and the widest possible area can be facilitated. Of course, the rest is plowed when the snow front has receded.

Have a nice winter week!",25.094627199984906,60.226886869174955

It was a really bad situation this morning when the car had been stuck in the alley right away in the morning, so the whole yard was practically closed. This problem is every winter. Of course, the house company's aura should also visit, but that's another story. Solvikinkuja is different from Solvikinkatu and there are parking spaces on its sides, but it is the only road from the house company out of the parking lots! The length of the alley is about 50m. Is it possible for it to be plowed, even in the middle of the car in the middle of the other streets, so that people can get to work. Today 13.1. In the morning, I went to Solvikinkatu running to your friendly aura driver and he plowed so much in front of the school taxi that we were able to dig him off. The rest of the street we shoveled by hand. Let's amazes the situation of this alley, when if it is plowed there, the snowstorm prevents our passage from the yard to the road? Did you have the opportunity to visit the area? Of course, I am also in touch with the house company's maintenance company, which does not arrive because the alley has not been plowed, so they will not ""plow"" the yards unless the plow came when the entire Solvikinkuja comes.

I live in the Star Military and I understand that the area is by no means important in the order of plowing.

It always stays in some way if and when it is obviously in the section. However, this street is used by many people a day and they try to survive everything from baby to elderly and dogs. However, the plower drives from that side, which is also a C area, so why not drive an important path to pedestrians at the same time?

I want to send a wish for plowing. It is a pillow lantern in Vuosaari. On the road and the parking lot at the end of the road, there is every winter when the snow surprises a terrible chaos. The road is small, but there is hard traffic in the mornings and afternoons because there is a school and a kindergarten at the end of the road. So it's not just a courtyard road used by Kafu residents.

The road is usually in such poor condition that there are cars in a mild uphill queue that have been stuck in the slush. Even the parking lot is always in a shocking condition. For several winters, the city has been given feedback by parents. Dozens of cars have been stuck there. In addition, chaos in the parking lot is dangerous when cars have to drive through the parking lot in the pedestrian area. There are a lot of children moving there. So I thought about putting this wish in good time. Not all of you have been plowed properly today, but I wish that there will be a plowing truck because of the nature and trafic as soon as possible.

Thank you!

The plowing is handled so that all the snow is pushed between the two doors at the top to take children to the orchard. Despite the calling of the nurses, property maintenance refuses to come to the remedy, but the workers themselves should blade the snow off the doors and gates. Real estate maintenance is in such a hurry that you can't have time. In front of the gates of the shelter, the shelter workers have already been forced to blacken the snow so that parents can bring and pick their children. It is scandalous that property maintenance does not do its job properly, now it is both kindergarten and young children. I do not want kindergarten employees to use their bad resources to create snow. I want them to take their time to take care of my children and others. This plowing has been a problem for several winters before, would it be time to finally change?

It would be quite reasonable and all sides of the kind to go to Vuosaari, for example, the Little Villasaari road was really slimy at 6:00 and good when I got out of the yard to turn on the road ...
Yesterday, it was really crazy to try even in the yard of the kindergarten (PK Kurkimoisio) when the whole road was not plowed and 4-5 cars were dug out of there, one of which was a van!
The plow did not arrive until around 7.45am ... I was late for this good job !!

It is incredible how the city even dares to leave residents on their own luck when the city would do great service and relief for residents to plow you for you !!!
Visit the road to Ramsinniemi ... The car breaks down because of those terrible cudders !!!

It is incomprehensible that the entire Tankomäenkatu and the environment (except for the street with a rescue service) is to be built full of apartment buildings, and there is no plowing and sidewalks to plow at all. During this snowstorm, I have watched the window of my home as the little kids walk to school and the snow is up to the thigh. After all, when mothers and fathers try to take toddlers to the nearby farm, they don't smile much. They have to circulate long runs on their stroller because no walkways have been plowed, and the strollers/wagons do not go with small walking stalks that are born when people try to leap in the snow for bus stops. Is this the price for that dense urban construction? Small people are completely forgotten. The purpose of this construction is to minimize the use of cars. It would probably be partly successful if the shortest possible walking trails to the nearest bus stop were made and the sidewalks would be plowed in the winter. You can't see that wonderfulness here. All who is able to travel by cars, but since Tankomäenkatu has not been plowed properly (and no plowed this morning 15.1) it has led to the cars stuck and slide transversely into the road. Other cars are queuing because they can't get any other route progressing. What about people who don't have a car? They are in trouble, especially older people, young students and parents of infants. They are also in danger of being left under these thrown cars. Praise for this dense urban construction and car -free Helsinki!

The contractor in this area is very lazy at work

Thank you for your message. I have directed your feedback to the area's leadership for information.

The snow should never be assembled in front of the entrances, but the site holder will remain the responsibility of the possible snowmobile removal after plowing. During the plowing of the lanes, the snow will plow on the sidewalks and inevitably also to plot connections. It is to some extent drivers to turn their plows at the plot connections
To minimize, but the ramparts cannot be completely avoided.

But, but if the city of Hg does not announce some /Twitter /online media, there may be problems for a long time. Here in Vuosaari, young people and children already find it great to jump in the dark in front of aura cars and snow collectors. The story gives you a great, daring video with friends. The latest craze is to dig out the tunnels that are then on the shovel borrowed in Stara's large snow piles without permission. Children /young people's play is ok in itself, but when the strength calculations fail and the children of the immigrant background remain inside the snow pile and no one notices in winter darkness.
Whose reason? City of Helsinki Stara and Subcontractors.
It would be worth trying to take the snowstorms from Aurinkolahti Square, Sand Pier Square and Lime Sand Drinking, even at night. If there are equipment and men free.
ps. The proper advice of a Finnish Finn does not even help, and parents with an immigrant background now definitely wants to walk on the ice, even with strollers from the Aurinkolahti beach. Although the ice cannot last.",,25.15014311226308,60.2014263328505

2021-01-16T18:05:10.197000,Tankomäenkatu (00950),"Hey,

My feedback applies to the maintenance of Tankomäenkatu (00950) in Mellunkylä.

The sidewalk today on the feedback day Sat 16.1.2021 continues to plow (unpaved spots are very difficult and impossible to travel with, for example, strollers or rollator).
Also a street roadway, hardened snow. The snow plowed is also piled on the sidewalk side to make it even more difficult to go there.

This Tankomäenkatu is influenced by the real Nomansland of the area.
As early as 2019, I have given feedback that the street should provide a similar permanent car transfer request (forbidden parking on a certain day of the week x times a month) as on similar residential streets (eg Puotila side). There is still no transfer call.
Both spring 2019 and 2020, the spring washing was not done, both times I made both written feedback, and I called the people responsible for the area for weeks.
The spring 2019 cleaning was finally done in the first week of June (about 2 months later in other streets in the area), in the spring of 2020 in early May (well over 1 month later than other streets in the area).

The problems of Tankomäenkatu are its incomplete, narrowness and parking on both sides of the street (there is no ban on this, so cars are even left directly in front of our house entrance to the street).
The sidewalks on the side of the even numbers are still waiting for the sidewalk, which was promised to start as early as August-September 2020 (Tankomäenkatu 6 and 8 housing manager Joona Eskola asked the city in late summer). All of the homes on the even numbers have been completed by May 2020.

On behalf of our own housing company and other users of that street, I look forward to the following activities from the area's maintenance:
- Winter maintenance will be improved immediately
- A permanent car transfer call for maintenance is ordered on the street to facilitate maintenance
- Spring cleaning will be handled this spring on time without having to complain several times
- Street construction will start in the spring as soon as the weather permitted

Regards,
","
Thanks for your message, and my apologies for e.g. There has been room for improvement in the quality of winter maintenance. Hopefully the situation in the area is already slightly relieved. We have had to prioritize the plowing trails after an exceptionally high snow, and only one half of the sidewalk has had to be plowed in some places. All possible plowing equipment is in use and we strive to balance the situation as soon as possible.

Hey!

In Vuosaari, it was almost impossible to move around the car this morning, when there was such a powerful area at the intersection of Hikkeilijänkatu near the road where all the smaller than the SUV was caught.

There have been problems with the road section throughout this snowfall. Would it be possible to move the road from the treatment class B to A? After all, there is a huge parking area with hundreds of cars at its width.
","Hello and thanks for your feedback,

This is a Asuntokatu, which serves the properties along it. Housing streets are, in principle, classified as always in the III (roadways) and C-category (corridors). In the class II, there are public transport streets and collector streets (collecting all the traffic from the residential streets) and in Class I, the main main routes (for example, Itäväylä).

There is no particular reason why it should be raised for raising the hiker. There is a type of traffic on the type of dwelling, and there is no activity that would support the category of street care. The P areas of real estate are not otherwise important.

It is also good to note that there are, for example, day care centers and schools (much more important destinations) along the residential streets, and that the basics have, in principle, only have only raised the treatment class. Because the resources are limited, unfortunately, some prioritization has to be done.

I understand that movement has not been easy this winter. So much snow came from that beginning of January (+50 cm) over a couple of days that the city started exceptional measures and the additional equipment was purchased. Even snow has already been transported for the city's reception sites.

He said he had been in contact with the city for four winters, but the situation is still the same: the asphalted roadway from the Vuosaari Park Path to the church will not be plowed or weed. Today, when the snow had come again, all other walkways had been plowed, but this was a small path. Is the relationship between the path in question somehow unclear between the church and the city or what is this? Can I check and get the situation in order?

This is dangerous in the dark because the unpaved clip is very close to the intersection. Cars that turn from the Itäväylä on both directions are in danger of driving over pedestrians. The pedestrian/cycle path along the Itäväylä is well plowed from the entire width to the junction of Linnavuori from the other direction, but as it turns to Linnavuorentie, the plowed area of ​​the sidewalk is very narrow (right next to Teboil entrance and mailboxes). Pedestrians often have to dodge this pile on the driveway just at the intersection. The sidewalk is often a slippery and driving road at this point after plowing.

The fairway is plowed from time to time and the snowy surface, which has been packed in the frost, works well, but in the first priority, I would also like to invest in anticipation.

I am aware that street maintenance involves both good and less good achievements. The basis for all your work is to maintain and ensure safe movement in your area of ​​responsibility. Am I right? Often, ""bad thing first"" is said. I follow this old phrase, too, and start with less good achievement. This time, it will be positioned in Vuosaari - one of the best part of our city - and there in the apartment building on the corner of Kaivonkatsojantie and Leikosaarentie and its Leikosaarentie courtyard:

On both sides of the fairway, a snow load in the surrounding area is usually piled up, which almost completely prevents visibility to the busy Leikosaarentie when entering the yard with the yard when that almost completely lacking safety view expands slightly more visible to the driveway, creating a situation where In such situations, in such situations, the good values ​​of the drivers are not always enough, but the familiar ""human factors"" emerge, I understand that from the controls of the heavy and tall work machines used in the work, those snowstarts may look very small, but we set up a passenger car driver as it goes covered mountains. The attachment is two photo-taking from a passenger car driver's seat to illustrate the above.

Well, it is so that heat and water will certainly take care of the day - but what about it?

Otherwise, you have done a good job of protecting nature at the tip of Kallanniemi and on the beautiful, beautiful terrain of Kalvikintie. Hopefully, your structural message goes to the consciousness of our area that we do not have to have our own path. Many thanks to you for all the nature cosmetologists - I dare to say - for all Vuosaari people in the area.
